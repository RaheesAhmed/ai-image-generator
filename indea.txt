i want  image prompt from the user’s description, incorporating additional formatting commands such as "Cinematic still", "cinematic scene", "32k resolution", and "landscape format" to ensure professional-quality images.

how to make call to openai to generate images sample code:
import OpenAI from "openai";

const openai = new OpenAI();

async function main() {
  const image = await openai.images.generate({ model: "dall-e-3", prompt: "A cute baby sea otter" });

  console.log(image.data);
}
main();



Implement a feature on the landing page to showcase the AI-generated image based on the user’s prompt. Include an option for users to download the image directly from the page.

Add a feature that allows the option to email the generated image to the user, should they choose this service.
